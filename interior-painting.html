        <h1>Interior Painting</h1>
        <p>
            Transform your home with a professional interior painting service that utilizes high-quality materials and expert techniques to create a flawless finish. The cost of your project is influenced by the materials you choose—such as durable paints for high-traffic areas versus matte finishes for bedrooms—and the complexity of the techniques used, from simple color changes to intricate stenciling, with overall project cost also varying based on your location. 
        </p>

        <h1>Techniques and Materials</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Professional techniques:</b> Our skilled painters use a combination of techniques, including precision cutting-in with a brush for sharp edges and broad rolling for smooth, even coverage on larger wall sections.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Premeium materials: </b>We select the right tools and materials for your project, from high-quality paints that ensure durability and color-true finishes to necessary prep supplies like caulk, primer, and drop cloths.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Surface preparation: </b>We select the right tools and materials for your project, from high-quality paints that ensure durability and color-true finishes to necessary prep supplies like caulk, primer, and drop cloths.
                 We start with thorough preparation, which may include <a href="crack-repair.html">wall repair</a>, sanding, and cleaning to ensure the best possible adhesion and a smooth final coat.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Interior Paint Types</h1>
        <p>
            Common types of interior wall paints include emulsion, latex, and oil-based paints, available in finishes such as matte, eggshell, satin, semi-gloss, and high-gloss. Emulsion and latex are water-based and popular for general walls—they dry quickly, have lower odor, and are easy to clean—while oil-based paints provide a very smooth, durable finish often used for trim, doors, and cabinets but take longer to dry and require solvent cleanup. Choose paint based on durability, moisture resistance (for kitchens and bathrooms), and the desired sheen for appearance and washability.
        </p>

        <h2>By Base: </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Water-based paints: </b>Also called emulsion or latex, these are popular for their easy cleanup with water, quick drying time, and low odor. They are a good choice for most interior walls. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Oil-based paints: </b>These are known for their durability and smooth finish, but they are harder to clean up and can have a strong odor. They are best suited for high-traffic areas like doors, trim, and cabinets, which require a strong, washable surface.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How many coats of paint do I need to change the colour of a wall?</h3>
            <p>
                Actual number of coats depends on the quality of paint as well as color shades you're switching to and from but expect atleast two coats to change color, especially when switching between light and dark shades or using vibrant colors. For a significant change, like dark to light, or when using high-pigment colors such as bright red, yellow, or orange, a third coat may be necessary to ensure complete coverage and a uniform finish. 
                A significant color change requires a second coat to completely cover the old color and prevent it from showing through. 
                Using a primer before painting can help reduce the number of coats needed, especially when making drastic color changes. Primers create a uniform base that enhances paint adhesion and coverage.
