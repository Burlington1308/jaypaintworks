        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How many coats of paint do I need to change the colour of a wall?</h3>
            <p>
                Actual number of coats depends on the quality of paint as well as color shades you're switching to and from but expect atleast two coats to change color, especially when switching between light and dark shades or using vibrant colors. For a significant change, like dark to light, or when using high-pigment colors such as bright red, yellow, or orange, a third coat may be necessary to ensure complete coverage and a uniform finish. 
                A significant color change requires a second coat to completely cover the old color and prevent it from showing through. 
                Using a primer before painting can help reduce the number of coats needed, especially when making drastic color changes. Primers create a uniform base that enhances paint adhesion and coverage.
