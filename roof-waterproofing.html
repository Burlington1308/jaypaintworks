            <h1>Waterproofing Techniques</h1>
            <p>
                We employ a variety of waterproofing techniques to ensure the best results for your roof. Our methods include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Liquid Membrane Application</li>
                <li>Sheet Membrane Installation</li>
                <li>Crack Injection</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Liquid Membrane Application</h2>
            <p>
                This technique involves applying a liquid waterproofing membrane to the roof surface. The liquid forms a seamless, flexible barrier that adheres to the roof,
                providing excellent protection against water infiltration. It is ideal for roofs with complex shapes and details.
            </p>

            <h2>Sheet Membrane Application</h2>
            <p>
                This method involves installing pre-formed sheets of waterproofing material onto the roof surface. The sheets are typically made of rubber, bitumen, or PVC,
                and are heat-welded or adhered to the roof. Sheet membranes provide a durable and long-lasting waterproofing solution, especially for flat or low-slope roofs.  
            </p>

            <h2>Crack Injection</h2>
            <p>
                This technique is used to seal cracks and gaps in the roof surface. A specialized waterproofing material is injected into the cracks, filling them and creating a watertight seal.
                Crack injection is an effective solution for repairing existing leaks and preventing future water infiltration.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How many coats of paint do I need to change the colour of a wall?</h3>
            <p>
                Actual number of coats depends on the quality of paint as well as color shades you're switching to and from but expect atleast two coats to change color, especially when switching between light and dark shades or using vibrant colors. For a significant change, like dark to light, or when using high-pigment colors such as bright red, yellow, or orange, a third coat may be necessary to ensure complete coverage and a uniform finish. 
                A significant color change requires a second coat to completely cover the old color and prevent it from showing through. 
                Using a primer before painting can help reduce the number of coats needed, especially when making drastic color changes. Primers create a uniform base that enhances paint adhesion and coverage.
